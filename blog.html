            <h2> Discuss the scope of var, let, and const ?
            </h2>
            <h3>=> The scope of a var variable is functional scope. The scope of a let variable is block scope. The
                scope of a const variable is block scope. It can be updated and re-declared into the scope.
            </h3>

            <h2>Tell us the use cases of null and undefined ?</h2>
            <h3>=> Undefined means the variable has been declared, but its value has not been assigned. Null means an
                empty value or a blank value. The typeof() operator returns undefined for an undefined variable. The
                typeof() operator returns the type as an object for a variable whose value is assigned as null.</h3>

            <h2>What do you mean by REST API?</h2>
            <h3>=> An API, or application programming interface, is a set of rules that define how applications or
                devices can connect to and communicate with each other. A REST API is an API that conforms to the design
                principles of the REST, or representational state transfer architectural style.</h3>
